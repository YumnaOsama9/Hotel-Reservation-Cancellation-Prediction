# Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation-Prediction
This project predicts if a hotel reservation will be canceled or honored based on customer and booking details. With more people booking online, cancellations and no-shows have increased, affecting hotel revenue. By using machine learning, this project helps predict cancellations so hotels can manage them better.
